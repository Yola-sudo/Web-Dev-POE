        <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
        <p>The AIDS Foundation of South Africa is leading the charge against HIV/AIDS by implementing a multi-faceted approach that combines prevention, treatment, and support services. Since its inception in 1988, the organization has been dedicated to delivering high-quality services to vulnerable communities, with a focus on promoting equality, education, and access to basic services.<br>
The foundation's strategy is built around addressing the root causes of the epidemic, including social and economic factors that exacerbate its impact. By targeting high-risk populations and areas, the organization aims to maximize its impact and bring about meaningful change.<br>

At the heart of the foundation's work is the UNAIDS 95-95-95 global target, which aims to ensure that:<br>
95% of people living with HIV know their status,95% of those who know their status receive treatment,95% of those who know their status receive treatment,95% of those on treatment achieve viral suppression
